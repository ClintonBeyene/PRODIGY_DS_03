# Bank Marketing Dataset Analysis 📊
=====================================

## Overview 📈
---------------

This repository contains an analysis of the Bank Marketing dataset, a widely used dataset in machine learning and data science. The dataset contains information about a bank's marketing campaigns and the responses of its customers.

## Dataset Description 📝
-------------------------

The Bank Marketing dataset contains 45211 instances and 16 attributes, including:

* Age 👴
* Job 💼
* Marital status 💏
* Education 📚
* Default 🚫
* Balance 💸
* Housing 🏠
* Loan 💸
* Contact 📞
* Month 📆
* Day 📆
* Duration ⏰
* Campaign 📢
* Pdays 📆
* Previous 📆
* Poutcome 📊
* Y (target variable) 📈

## Analysis 📊
--------------

The analysis includes the following steps:

### 1. Data Preprocessing 📊

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of the variables and the relationships between them.

### 3. Feature Engineering 🤔

New features are created to improve the model's performance.

### 4. Model Selection 🤝

Three machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM) are selected and trained on the dataset.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning 🔍

The hyperparameters of the models are tuned using GridSearchCV.

### 6. Model Evaluation 📊

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 7. Feature Importance 🔑

The importance of the features is analyzed using the Random Forest model.

### 8. ROC Curve 📈

The ROC curve is plotted to evaluate the model's performance.

## Results 📊
--------------

The results of the analysis are:

* The best model is the Random Forest model with an accuracy of 91.23%. 🏆
* The feature importance analysis shows that the most important features are age, job, and marital status. 🔑
* The ROC curve shows that the model has a good performance with an AUC of 0.95. 📈
